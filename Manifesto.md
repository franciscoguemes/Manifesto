# The Pragmatic Developer Manifesto  
### *Principles, Tools, and Unshakable Convictions*  

**As a developer with 20 years of experience, I stand by the following:**  

---

## **Core Beliefs**  
1. **Open Source First**  
   - I prioritize open-source software over proprietary solutions, unless no viable alternative exists. Freedom, transparency, and community drive innovation.  

2. **Everything is Code**  
   - Source code, infrastructure (IaC), documentation (Markdown, Mermaid), even CI/CD pipelines—version it, review it, treat it as craft.  

3. **Infrastructure as Craftsmanship**  
   - Every deployment, container, or cloud resource must be deliberate, reproducible, and minimal. No black boxes.  

4. **AI as an Ally, Not a Crutch**  
   - I embrace AI for productivity (LLMs, Copilot, etc...) but I reject blind code generation. AI is a tool, not the driver.  

5. **Vibes Matter**  
   - Clean code, ergonomic tooling, and a distraction-free environment are non-negotiable. Developer happiness fuels quality.

## **Ethics**  
- **Privacy is a Universal Right**: Not a luxury. Systems must respect user data by default - minimize collection, encrypt relentlessly.  
- **Sustainable Tech**: Avoid wasteful architectures. Efficiency is elegance.  
- **No Dark Patterns**: UI/UX should empower, not manipulate.  
- **Human First**: Technology should serve people, not the other way around.  

---

## **The Toolchain**  
### **Development**  
- **Languages**: Java (general-purpose), JavaScript (frontend/browser *only*).  
- **Ecosystem**: IntelliJ IDEA, Maven, Spring/Spring Boot, Hibernate, Lombok.  
- **Scripting**: Bash. Always.  

### **Version Control & Collaboration**  
- **Git**: The only SCM. Branching strategy depends on context, but history is sacred.  

### **Packaging & Deployment**  
- **Containers**: Docker/Podman (+ Compose), Kubernetes (Helmcharts, Kustomize).  
- **Packaging**: AppImage for desktop apps—no bloated installers.  

### **OS & Infrastructure**  
- **Linux**: The only OS for serious work. WSL is a concession, not a solution.  
- **Cloud**: Agnostic but principled. Prefer managed services over reinventing wheels.  

### **Frontend**  
- JavaScript/TypeScript for browsers—no Electron, no desktop hybrids. The web belongs in browsers.  

---

## **Anti-Patterns I Reject**  
1. **Overengineering**: If it's a monolith, make it a *good* monolith. Microservices aren't a default.  
2. **Hype-Driven Development**: New ≠ better. I evaluate tools on merit, not trends.  
3. **Lock-In**: Vendor-neutral stacks > proprietary "magic."  

---

## **The Vibe**  
- **Silence**: No music, no distractions. Deep work requires focus.  
- **No Interruptions**: Respect the flow state. Messages can wait.  
- **Mindfulness Over Multi-Tasking**: One task at a time, done well.  
- **Terminal**: Tmux + Neovim for quick edits, IDE for heavy lifting.  
- **Documentation**: Write it or regret it.  

---

## **The Pledge**  
I commit to:  
- Writing code that outlives my involvement in the project  
- Mentoring the next generation of developers  
- Leaving systems better than I found them  
- Speaking up against unethical practices  
- Balancing pragmatism with principles  

---

**This is my craft. These are my tools. This is the way.**
